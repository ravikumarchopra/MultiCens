# MultiCens

MultiCens is platform from where users can predict hormone-responsive genes in a target tissue by providing the inputs such as Source and target tissue names, the mediator hormone, and the list of genes from source and the target tissues. The tool will take the list of genes from the source tissue and will rank the hormone-responsive genes from the target tissue gene list by their responsiveness for the selected hormone. <br><br>
